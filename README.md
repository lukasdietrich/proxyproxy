# proxyproxy

An http proxy to proxy another http proxy ðŸ¤ª

## Usecase

Imagine you worked for a company that only allowed internet traffic through an http proxy and
rolled it out via pac[^1] file. Now imagine that most programs under linux do not support pac[^1].

Some of us don't have to imagine that.

This application acts as a proxy between applications and the corporate http proxy.
This way, applications can use environment variables[^2] to route their traffic through proxyproxy,
which in turn understands the pac[^1] file and routes the traffic to the desired upstream proxy.
